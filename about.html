     <h1>&nbsp;ABOUT US</h1>
    <div><img src="images/about.jpg" alt="Catering Items" height="277px" width="600px" class="cateringimg">
   <p id="about">Buddha Bellies story is one of legend in the noodle community:
A fantastic soup chef realized his obsession with noodles while travelling thru Asia.
 Armed with a degree in soup from the University of Food Lovers, Michael immediately moved to Asia upon graduating and explored his love of everything Asian. He returned to the US in 1990, and after some career experimentation, found his way to the Culinary Institute of Noodles, where he finally found his calling.</p>
   <p id="about">
 Upon graduation from the CIN and working as head chef at Noodle and Noodle, Michael returned to Asia to rediscover his Asian roots.  He taught cooking classes, explored his options and enjoyed his time exploring the markets.  Michael eventually realized it was time to combine his love for Asia and cooking, and in 2007 Buddha Bellies was born. 
Buddha Bellies not only succeeded, but became one of the top noodle shops in Saigon, an unheard of accomplishment for a foreigner.  In 2010 a second shop, was opened.  In 2012, Michael returned to Portland with the hopes of opening a shop in his home town while continuing to operate his two shops in Saigon.
